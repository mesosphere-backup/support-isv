## Spinnaker Specific

All Spinnaker services except `redis` and `deck` are springboot applications which write logs to stdout. In the service config section of the Spinnaker service debug level log output can be enabled for the springboot based services. When doing config changes for one of the spinnaker services it stdout log should be observed.
